# MVC pattern Base

The file you'll need to run is the main.py that's outside the folders, otherwise you won't be able to see things.

This is a repository to have a strong foundation on what you need to work with a multiframe app with MVC pattern
with tkinter.

I personally will be using this for making tests.
